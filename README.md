# 🏥 Agentic AI for Pharma Stockout Detection & Prevention  
### Hemas Pharma – 2026

An intelligent, SAP-integrated system designed to detect, predict, and prevent stockouts of critical pharmaceutical SKUs using AI-driven forecasting, risk modeling, and rule-based planning.

## Objective

Build a proactive stockout prevention system that:

- Detects out-of-stock risks early  
- Identifies internal & external root causes  
- Forecasts demand accurately  
- Projects future inventory  
- Generates compliant replenishment recommendations  
- Supports explainable AI + human flagging  

## 🧠 Core Engines

### 1️⃣ Demand Forecast Engine

- Historical data collection  
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Forecast generation  
- Accuracy monitoring
  
### 2️⃣ Projected Inventory Engine

- Current inventory retrieval  
- Days-of-cover threshold checks  
- FEFO (expiry-aware logic)  
- Future stock projection  

### 3️⃣ Risk Engine

Classifies SKUs into:

- 🔴 High Risk  
- 🟢 Low Risk  

#### Risk Drivers

**Internal Factors**
- Forecasting inaccuracy  
- Demand planning inefficiencies  
- Negative inventory  
- Data validation issues
- Import license expiry  
- Product registration issues
- Low distributor stock  

**External Factors**
- Government regulations  
- Global conflicts  
- Weather disruptions
- Supplier reliability  

### 4️⃣ Planning / Recommendation Engine

Applies business rules and constraints:

- MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity)  
- Max Inventory Days  
- Credit Terms  
- Stock in Hand  
- Import License Validity  
- Product Registration Status  

**Outputs:**

- Recommended replenishment quantity  
- Suggested order timing  
- Risk flag indicators  
- Explainable reasoning
